A Medical History app

A Medical History app to streamline history taking in medical settings and allow for multilingual translation. 

## The Aim: 
for everyone to have their medical history and data easily accessible and presentable to the medical team when necessary. In a Primary Care setting / A&E, the patient will be able to write their presenting complaint to make it faster for the doctor to get their medical history. 

## Why:
While it is important for doctors to speak to their patients to develop a bond which defines healthcare, it is not a secret that A&E and GP wait times are frustrating for both patients and doctors. This app will allow a patientâ€™s medical history to be summarized for the doctors, allowing them to skip to the more pertinent follow up questions. It also removes the language barrier whenever it is present, which in the world of ever-growing tourism, grows with it.

## Who benefits: 
Hospitals and Care establishments â€“ Streamlining Patient intake and reducing wait times

Doctors â€“ avoids repetition and allows for follow up questions a lot faster, to move care along quicker, avoids language barriers

Patients â€“ do not have to struggle with explaining in a high anxiety situation

General Public â€“ have quickly accessible medical history in case of acute medical scenario, for paramedics/doctors 



How it works â€“ 
*To be optimized*
Patients fill out presenting complaint in waiting area ðŸ¡ª doctor reads summarized version ðŸ¡ª doctor asks follow-up questions
